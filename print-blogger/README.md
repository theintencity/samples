# Print Blogger

This Chrome extension allows me to create a printable PDF of my 
blog articles such as 
[WebRTC topology](https://blog.kundansingh.com/2024/06/a-deep-dive-into-webrtc-topology.html),
[generic video-io](https://blog.kundansingh.com/2019/06/a-generic-video-io-component-for-webrtc.html) or
or [Lessons in web software](https://blog.kundansingh.com/2019/06/lessons-in-web-software-development.html)
hosted on Google blogspot or blogger. It should work on my other blog pages too.

Just open any of my blog pages, and click on the icon of the extension,
after installation.

### Install

You can visit the Chrome extension web store to install the extension directly
in your Chrome browser.

Alternatively, you can use the source code here to load an unpacked extension in
the browser, in developer mode.

Once installed, visit any of my blog pages linked from above, and then
click on the browser extension icon next to the address bar.

### Privacy

The extension does not collect any data or logs.

This extension only works on my blog. To make it work on any other blog,
please edit the configuration locally.

### Note

This tool is not affiliated or supported by Blogger. This is just a convenient way
to print my blog articles.
